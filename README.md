# Personal Blog
I created my personal blog following two main goals:

* Build a real life project with Angular
* Improve my Blog writing skills 
* Integrate latest technologies

When I first started I didn't use any CLI (although there was a beta at the time) and Angular 2 was recently released I worked with Angular Material Design [material2](https://github.com/angular/material2) alpha which was under active development. Then I included [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) beta. Right now the project is in Angular 4 (current version of Angular) and being maintained every couple of months as I want to test something now or just integrate the latest upgrades.

I wrotte a small Rest API using Ruby on Rails in the next  [link](https://github.com/meiordac/personal-blog-api) to allow me to persist my posts and comments, and practice the integration with a real life API.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Deploying to Github Pages

Run `npm run deploy` to deploy to Github Pages. I am using an external libraries for this purpose which should be installed before using this. 

## Further help

To get more help on the `angular-cli` use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular-CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
